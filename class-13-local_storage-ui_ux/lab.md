# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 13

### New Bus Mall Technical Goal

- Give your BusMall app persistence by using local storage to store your voting data! The goal is to have all of your data persist through a page refresh or through completely closing the browser. That way, the more time you go through the sets of 25 votes, the more the data accumulates and you get a more reliable understanding of which items are popular.

## Individual Work

Be sure to go back and re-read [the original problem domain from Class 11](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-201d19/blob/master/class-11-av-practical-clicktracker/lab.md). Today we'll be focusing on implementing all of the little pieces that have not been finished so far. Make sure you are not forgetting anything.

- You are also responsible for the overall look and feel of the app (the UI/UX, in other words), so don't forget a custom font, color palette, layout with semantic HTML, and so on. The basic layout of three side-by-side-by-side images with a chart underneath holds, but beyond that, it's all you.
