# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 6 - Pat's Salmon Cookies

In class, we learned how to model an entity in JavaScript using objects. Now, it's your turn to start building an application that models the problem domain in the support doc linked in *Helpful Resources*.

You will also simultaneously be working with more specific style and design concepts through this assignment.

**Today's work is done solo. I want you all to have the basis for your Cookie Store built before pairing up!**

*Before writing a single line of code, be sure that you have a new repository (with a README!) called `cookie-stand`, and do your work in that directory.*

*Each day you'll be working in separate branches. Once the repo is initialized and set up today, switch to a new branch for your work. Today's branch will be `monday-literals`.*

## User Stories (MVP)
 - As a user, I want a webpage that displays individual store data for my Salmon Cookie Shops, so that I can be informed about how to run my business
 - As a developer, I want to represent the store data in a list format on the webpage, so my client can view the information
 - As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand

## Technical Requirements
 - New repository properly set up with a license and README, and cloned to local machine
 - Working on a non-master branch, with regular commit history
 - Good use of Object Literals **(no constructors allowed today)**; one for each store model; properties/values and methods are correctly constructed and given meaningful names
 - Main page meets requirements of the problem domain
 - Stores are correctly rendering as lists to the main page

## User Stories (Stretch... only after completing everything above)
 - As a developer, I want to make some headway on the public-facing page for the business
